> Still trying to figure out how to get the sfEvent to register that text is being typed. At the moment, I'm passing down the sfEvent from the State Class down to the textbox, however, it doesn't seem that it is being polled correctly. It doesn't register that text is being entered when it is. I think I have to look around and see where the event is polled and maybe that will reveal something.
