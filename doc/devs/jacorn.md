> Still trying to figure out how to get the sfEvent to register that text is being typed. At the moment, I'm passing down the sfEvent from the State Class down to the textbox, however, it doesn't seem that it is being polled correctly. It doesn't register that text is being entered when it is. I think I have to look around and see where the event is polled and maybe that will reveal something.

> Questions: Is there a reason that there are repeated functions in the Overworld.hpp and GameState.hpp files? Should I transfer some of the functions into Overworld.hpp to remove clutter? Is all of it from when you created the Overworld and Underworld classes?
